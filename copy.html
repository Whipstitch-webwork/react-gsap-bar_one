<h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p className="show">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be said that our story began out of necessity and that would'nt be far from the truth. The economic downturn of the early eighties forced many of Hartford's legendary family owned bars & pubs to be sold off - usually to a corporate entity.
    </p> 
    <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result it became nearly impossible to find a good cocktail. A cocktail that wasn't drempt up in a boardroom some place by a bunch of guys in suits. You know. Some funny colored drink you never heard of.</p>
    <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a group of local friends scrapped together their life savings and founded BarNone with only one mission - to deliver classic cocktails that are crafted using the finest liquors and historic specifications.</p>
